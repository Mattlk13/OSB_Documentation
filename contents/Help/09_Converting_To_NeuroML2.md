### Convert your model to NeuroML 2

Converting models to the simulator independent format [NeuroML 2](https://www.neuroml.org/neuromlv2) enables conversion of the model to [many different formats](https://www.neuroml.org/mappings), as well as enables many of the advanced features of OSB to be used with your model (e.g. 3D visualisation of [cells](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/l5bpyrcellhayetal2011?explorer=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.github.com%2FOpenSourceBrain%2FL5bPyrCellHayEtAl2011%2Fmaster%2FneuroConstruct%2FgeneratedNeuroML2%2FL5PC.cell.nml) & [networks](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/acnet2?explorer=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.github.com%2FOpenSourceBrain%2FACnet2%2Fmaster%2FneuroConstruct%2FgeneratedNeuroML2%2FMediumNet.net.nml)).

### API for OSB

An API for getting access to information contained in OSB projects has been developed.

See https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/OSB_API.

This is based on the [REST API](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest_api) which was developed for [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org), the framework on which OSB is based. 

An example of the data returned by this API for each project can be see here: http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/thalamocortical.xml.

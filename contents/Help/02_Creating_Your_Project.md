### On ModelDB?

First of all, if the model is published, please submit the original scripts to [ModelDB](http://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/default.asp*). This is the correct place for depositing models at the time of publication and should be the first port of call for anyone looking for scripts related to a publication in computational neuroscience.

Placing a model on OSB in addition to ModelDB is an indication that you wish to develop your (or other modellers’ publicly shared) models in an open source collaborative environment, to get help debugging/improving them, to convert them to simulator independent formats, and generally encourage wider reuse.

### Sign up to OSB

Register as a user of OSB [here](/account/register). Add your GitHub username and [INCF user profile](http://incf.org/community/people) if you have one.

You should also add the URL of your project, software or lab. In the latter case, if the PI is in agreement, we can add the group to the list of [labs taking part in the OSB initiative](/about#who_about).

### Share your code

Create a new repository for your code on GitHub (see [here](/doc/Help/Some_Extra_Information) if want to know more about Source Code tecnologies and Git/GitHub). See the introduction to this on [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo). You can use the short project name above for the repository name.

This can be hosted on the [OpenSourceBrain GitHub organisation](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain), but there is no problem having it under your personal account. If you would like us to host the repository, <a href="mailto:info@opensourcebrain.org">let us know</a> and we’ll add the repository and give your GitHub user full access to it.

Note, you can also get in contact on info@opensourcebrain.org to discuss with us about setting up the project for you.

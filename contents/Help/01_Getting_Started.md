### Browse one of the projects

For example [GranCellSolinasEtAl10](/projects/grancellsolinasetal10) - Granule Cell by Solinas et al. 2010

This project contains a single compartment model of a cerebellar granule cell. This, like many other projects is based on a [neuroConstruct](http://www.neuroConstruct.org) project containing the NeuroML elements of the model. neuroConstruct can facilitate generating code for running the model in simulators like NEURON & MOOSE.

See [here](/docs#Using_Neuro_Construct_Based_Projects) for info on using the neuroConstruct GUI with OSB projects.

### Clone a project for your own local copy

If you do not know about Git and GitHub click [here](/docs/Help/Some_Extra_Information) for a quick explanation and some useful links. 

The previous project can be cloned using the following command: 

`git clone git://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/GranCellSolinasEtAl10.git`


If the project contains a neuroConstruct project to facilitate generating scripts for multiple simulators (it contains a **neuroConstruct** directory), see here: project:neuroconstructprojects.

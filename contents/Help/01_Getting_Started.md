[Granule Cell Layer](/projects/grancelllayer)


For example [GranCellSolinasEtAl10](/projects/grancellsolinasetal10) - Granule Cell by Solinas et al. 2010

This project contains a single compartment model of a cerebellar granule cell. This, like many other projects is based on a [neuroConstruct](http://www.neuroConstruct.org) project containing the NeuroML elements of the model. neuroConstruct can facilitate generating code for running the model in simulators like NEURON & MOOSE.

See [here](/doc#Using_Neuro_Construct_Based_Projects) for info on using the neuroConstruct GUI with OSB projects.

neuroConstruct projects can be translated into HTML descriptions of the model elements. See [here](/embedded/grancellsolinasetal10) for an example.

### Clone the project for your own local copy

If you do not know what is Git and GitHub click [here](/doc/Help/Some_Extra_Information) for a quick explanation and some useful links. 

The previous projects can be clone using the following commands: 

`git clone git://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/GranCellSolinasEtAl10.git`

`git clone git://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/GranCellSolinasEtAl10.git`

If the project contains a neuroConstruct project to facilitate generating scripts for multiple simulators (it contains a **neuroConstruct** directory), see here: project:neuroconstructprojects.

### Welcome to Open Source Brain!

We hope you'll find the information you require here, but if not, please [get in touch](/docs#How_To_Contact_Us).
Below is a brief video tour, see the [five minute introduction](/docs#Five_Minute_Introduction) for a more detailed guide.

### Browse the projects currently available on OSB

Here is a quick video showing some of the tools you can use for browsing the projects on OSB.

### Browse one of the projects

To get a feel for what a typical project on OSB contains, have a look through [GranCellSolinasEtAl10](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/grancellsolinasetal10) - Granule Cell by Solinas et al. 2010

This project contains a single compartment model of a cerebellar granule cell. This, like many other projects is based on a [neuroConstruct](http://www.neuroConstruct.org) project containing the NeuroML elements of the model. neuroConstruct can facilitate generating code for running the model in simulators like NEURON & MOOSE.


### Clone a project for your own local copy

If you're not familiar with Git or GitHub click [here](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/docs/Help/Background_Information#Introduction_to_Source_Control) for a quick explanation and some useful links. 

The project mentioned above can be cloned using the following command: 

`git clone git://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/GranCellSolinasEtAl10.git`


If the project contains a neuroConstruct project to facilitate generating scripts for multiple simulators (it contains a **neuroConstruct** directory), see [here](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/docs#Using_neuroConstruct_Based_Projects).

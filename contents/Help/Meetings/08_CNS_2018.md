### Developing, standardising and sharing large scale cortical network models


A workshop at [CNS 2018](http://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2018-workshops), Tues 17th July, Allen Institute, Seattle

A number of groups around the world are developing complex, experimentally constrained models of cortical function. Creating the software infrastructure to develop, simulate and share these types of models takes a significant amount of time for any of the groups involved and there can be a lot of overlap, duplication in work and repeated effort. 

This workshop aims to highlight some of the initiatives currently underway to build detailed cortical models as well as those projects building the infrastructure to make it easier to develop, disseminate and compare the models. Attendees of this workshop will come away with a better idea of the state of the art in large scale cortical model development and the efforts underway to make these more accessible and reusable for other researchers.

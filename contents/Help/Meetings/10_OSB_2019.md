## Overview of the meeting

Open Source Brain (http://www.opensourcebrain.org) was created as a platform for sharing and collaboratively developing models in computational neuroscience. Models of cells and circuits in standardised formats can be visualised, analysed and simulated through a standard web browser. The aim has been to improve the quality, accessibility and scientific rigour of models used to investigate brain function.

Following a renewal of our funding from the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.ac.uk/), we are expanding the functionality of the platform to also enable sharing of the experimental data behind the models. The **OSB workshop 2019** highlighted the latest features of OSB and engaged current and future users of the platform through invited talks, hands on demonstrations, and user presentations. 

The **two key themes** of the meeting were:

**1) Accessible sharing of cellular neuroscience data**

Through support for the [Neurodata Without Borders](https://www.nwb.org/) (NWB) format, OSB will facilitate sharing of multiple types of experimental data used to constrain computational models, including electrophysiological recordings, Ca<sup>2+</sup> florescence imaging, 2D, 3D and 4D imaging and behavioural data.   

**2) Modelling the cortex across scales**

Cortical networks are modelled at many scales from abstract representations of interacting populations (neural masses) to networks of biophysically and morphologically detailed cell models. [NeuroML](https://www.neuroml.org/) is being expanded to cover a greater range of these models, which will allow them to be shared and simulated on OSB, facilitating comparison of models and ideas between researchers. This ongoing work is taking place as part of the [SIG on Standardised Representations of Network Structures](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/Networks_SIG).

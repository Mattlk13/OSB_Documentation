There will be an [Open Source Brain](http://www.opensourcebrain.org) workshop in Alghero, Sardinia in September 2019.


| Dates | **9am Monday 9th Sept. - 5pm Wednesday 11th Sept., 2019** |
| :------|-------|
| **Location** | Hotel Calabona, [Alghero](http://www.alghero-turismo.it/en/), Sardinia |
| **Organising committee** | [Padraig Gleeson](/users/4), [Angus Silver](/users/6)|


### Overview of the meeting

Open Source Brain (http://www.opensourcebrain.org) was created as a platform for sharing and collaboratively developing models in computational neuroscience. Models of cells and circuits in standardised formats can be visualised, analysed and simulated through a standard web browser. The aim has been to improve the quality, accessibility and scientific rigour of models used to investigate brain function.

Following a renewal of our funding from the [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.ac.uk/), we are expanding the functionality of the platform to also enable sharing of the experimental data behind the models. The **2019 OSB Workshop** will highlight the latest features of OSB and engage current and future users of the platform through invited talks, hands on demonstrations, and user presentations. 

The **two key themes** of the meeting will be:

**1) Accessible sharing of cellular neuroscience data**

Through support for the [Neurodata Without Borders](https://www.nwb.org/) (NWB) format, OSB will facilitate sharing of multiple types of experimental data used to constrain computational models, including electrophysiological recordings, Ca<sup>2+</sup> florescence imaging, 2D, 3D and 4D imaging and behavioural data.   

**2) Modelling the cortex across scales**

Cortical networks are modelled at many scales from abstract representations of interacting populations (neural masses) to networks of biophysically and morphologically detailed cell models. [NeuroML](https://www.neuroml.org/) is being expanded to cover a greater range of these models, which will allow them to be shared and simulated on OSB, facilitating comparison of models and ideas between researchers. This ongoing work is taking place as part of the [SIG on Standardised Representations of Network Structures](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/Networks_SIG).

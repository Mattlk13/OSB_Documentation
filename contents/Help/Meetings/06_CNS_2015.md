# Open collaboration in computational neuroscience

### A workshop at [CNS 2015](http://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2015-prague)

**July 22 OR 23, Prague, Czech Republic (date of workshop not finalised)**

Building and analysing biophysically and anatomically detailed neuronal networks is a 
complex and time consuming task, which ideally involves researchers with a range of 
backgrounds and technical skills. However, most labs cannot expect to have all of these 
researchers present at any given time. This can lead to stalled projects, lost data/software 
and needless repetition of experimental and computational work. 
 
A number of initiatives have been started which address these issues. Some are creating 
public resources with freely available data to constrain such models. Others are using best 
practices from open source software development to encourage building and sharing of 
models in a collaborative environment. This workshop will serve as an informative introduction 
to these projects as well as a discussion forum for getting feedback and gathering 
requirements from the community for the developers of these initiatives.

# Open collaboration in computational neuroscience

### A workshop at [CNS 2015](http://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2015-prague)

**Thursday July 23 2015, Prague, Czech Republic**

Building and analysing biophysically and anatomically detailed neuronal networks is a complex and time consuming task, which ideally involves researchers with a range of backgrounds and technical skills. However, most labs cannot expect to have all of these researchers present at any given time. This can lead to stalled projects, lost data/software and needless repetition of experimental and computational work. 
 
A number of initiatives have been started which address these issues. Some are creating public resources with freely available data to constrain such models. Others are using best practices from open source software development to encourage building and sharing of models in a collaborative environment. This workshop will serve as an informative introduction to these projects as well as a discussion forum for getting feedback and gathering requirements from the community for the developers of these initiatives.  

**Organisers:** Padraig Gleeson (University College London) & Aurel A. Lazar (Columbia University)
